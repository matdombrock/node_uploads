A simple example of how to handle file uploads with NodeJS + Formidable.

To run, just change the path on line 8 of ```app.js``` to match that path of the ```uploads``` directory in this repo and do:
```
node app.js
```
Then navigate your browser to ```localhost:1337``` and you will be able to upload a file. 


NOTE: This is a "fixed" version of the code found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_uploadfiles.asp) and is only reproduced here for my reference.
